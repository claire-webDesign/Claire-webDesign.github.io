        <h1> STILL I RISE by Maya Angelou </h1>
        <p> <strong>You</strong> may write me down in history with your bitter, twisted lies</p> 
        <p> <strong>You</strong> may trod me in the very dirt</p>
        <p><em> But still, like dust, I'll rise </em></p>

        <p> Does <strong>my </strong>sassiness upset you?</p>
        <p> Why are <strong> you </strong> beset with <em> gloom?</em></p>
        <p>â€™Cause I walk like I've got oil wells</p>
        <p> Pumping in <strong>my</strong> living room.</p>
